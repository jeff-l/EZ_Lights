****************
* Requirements *
****************
Java      1.6 has been used in the development of this project, but it is likely 
              that versions as early as 1.2 will work
log4j     http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html
ANT       http://jakarta.apache.org/ant (make sure to get the optional.jar file!)

Access to the USB is gained through the JCP software (which has its own dependencies)
The JCP web site is: http://jcp.org

After installing the JCP software:
  Add lib/jsr80_linux.jar to your CLASSPATH.
  Add the directory containing javax.usb.properties to your CLASSPATH.
  Add the directory containing libJavaxUsb.so to your LD_LIBARRY_PATH
  
To attach to the transceiver, you will need write access to the /dev/usb tree
  You can run the program as root or an account with super user priviliges
  You can change the permissons of the /dev/usb tree
  For more information, see the README file in the JCP software

* Build *

Run ant (no arguments required) from the EZ_Lights directory


****************
* Installation *
****************

Add the EZ_Lights/resources directory to CLASSPATH so the software can access
Add the EZ_Lights/bin directory to CLASSPATH for access to the EZ_Lights code

***********
* Running *
***********

java EZ_Lights

*******************
* Troubleshooting *
*******************

If you are having trouble connecting to the transceiver, it is often a 
permission problem with the /dev/usb device tree.

Also, other drivers may claim the transceiver before this program runs. See
the /var/log/messages to see if this is the case.
